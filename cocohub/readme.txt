Create advanced chatbots and connect them to your website. Use existing components or create new ones using Dialogflow, MS bot framework, Rasa and more.

== Description ==

With CoCoHub builder you can build your bot with components using drag and drop.

CoCoHub is an invaluable complementary tool for chatbot developers, offering pre-built, customizable & tested conversational components which enhance bot capabilities and eliminate the need for writing and maintaining AI conversation boilerplates or low-level conversation logic. 
Use existing components or create new ones using Dialogflow, MS bot framework, Rasa and more.

Our growing hub of shareable, modular conversational components is the first of its kind and represents a paradigm shift in how we design and interact with conversational AI.

Pre-built Conversational components incorporated into your bot framework make it flexible, maintain contextual flow throughout conversations and deliver the goals you require faster.

You can also customize your components or repurpose them to cut down development costs, improve the quality of conversations, and facilitate faster bot deployment.
